      <p>
        Our mission is to create a supportive and dynamic environment where
        students with an interest in computer science can come together to
        explore their passions, enhance their skills, and collaborate on
        projects that challenge their creativity. We aim to make learning about
        CS fun and accessible for everyone, regardless of their experience
        level.

      <p>
        By participating in our club, members will have the opportunity to
        engage in coding competitions, attend workshops, and work on group
        projects that not only build technical skills but also foster
        friendships and a sense of community.

      <h3 class="border-bottom border-light-grey padding-16">About</h3>
      <p>
        We are the Coding Club, a group of enthusiastic students who love
        technology and innovation. Our focus is on learning about data
        structures and algorithmsâ€”the fundamental concepts that allow you to
        manipulate data efficiently and solve complex problems through code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a beginner just starting out or an experienced coder, we
        provide a platform for you to grow your skills, share your knowledge,
        and take on new challenges. We regularly participate in CS competitions,
        giving our members a chance to test their abilities in a competitive yet
        friendly environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joining our club means becoming part of a community of like-minded
        students who are eager to learn and create. We believe in the power of
        collaboration and encourage our members to work together on projects,
        share ideas, and support each other in their learning journeys.
